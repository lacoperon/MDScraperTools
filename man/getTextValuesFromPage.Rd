\title{Web Scraper Function}
\usage{
getTextValuesFromPage(url, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The url corresponding to the website in question}

\item{path}{The xpath associated with the elements we want to grab the text inside}
}
\description{
This function allows you to scrape the text values within multiple elements,
specified by the xpath `path`, on a particular website referenced by `url`.
This serves as a helper function to scrape sites relevant to
Bioinformatics-based purposes, and as this package is developed I will add
more higher-level functions that scrape from commonly used sites. But in the
meantime (and I'm sure for a long time to come), this will be handy. If you
are trying to scrape one particular element, see `getTextValueFromPage`.
